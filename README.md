# ⚛️ **My PennyLane Quantum Computing Notes**

Welcome to my personal repository for the PennyLane Quantum Computing course! This collection contains my solutions for the exercises found in the [PennyLane Codebook](https://pennylane.ai/codebook).

## 📂 **Repository Structure**

The repository is organized based on the modules of the course I completed. Each Python file corresponds to a specific topic.

* **`00_Pennylane_Fundamentals.py`**: Basic concepts of PennyLane

* **`01_Introduction.py`**: Introduction to key theoretical concepts such as qubits and quantum circuit construction.

* **`02_Single_Qbit_Gates.py`**: Exploration of the most important single-qubit gates (X, H, Z), phase gates, rotations (RX, RY) and state preparation.

* **`03_Circuits_With_Many_Qbits.py`**: Handling multi-qubit systems and controlled gates like CNOT, CZ, SWAP, and Toffoli.

* **`04_Hamiltonian_Evolution.py`**: Simulation of physical systems, unitaries, Hamiltonians, energy calculation, etc

* **`05_Noicy_Imput.py`**: Introduction to noisy quantum theory and working with mixed states, operations
